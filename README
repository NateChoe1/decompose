Usage: decompose

decompose will read in from the microphone and output to the speaker with
pulseaudio. Note that in pulseaudio there is a dummy output, and the inputs of
the form "Monitor of [output]" allow you to capture speaker output. This means
that you can set the input for this program to the audio you want to decompose,
set the output to the dummy output, and record the dummy output.
